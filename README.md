# pyduml_menu
=======

A menu selection system for hdnes' pyduml.py script for flashing/rooting DJI devices, which makes the process stupidly simple.

RC's can be finicky. If your RC refuses to play (refuses FTP) heres a possible fix:

1. turn off the RC
2. unplug it from the computer
3. Turn it back on
4. Turn it off again (don't you hate that beeper!!!)
5. Plug it back in
6. run pyduml.py
7. Turn the RC back on when prompted by the script
